# Maven parent POMs

This directory contains maven parent POMs that we are using in our 
child projects.

They are obviously managed with Maven, and bundled mvnw can be used to
perform necessary actions.

`VERSION` file contains current version and allows to perform deploys 
on version change rather than on every commit.
